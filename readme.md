# SAFE

Android mobile app that accompanies the SAFE cabinet. The SAFE cabinet was developed as a parcial requirement to obtain a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering.

## What is the SAFE?
From the Portuguese, SAFE stands for "Solução para Armazenamento de Ferramentas e Equipamentos, or in English: Storing Solution for Tools and Equipments.The main idea is that in the industry, many time the operators need to borrow equipment to be used on a certain activity, however, more often than not, there is no control whatsoever regarding who is in control of such equipment. 

In this sense, the proposed solution aims to deal with that offering the possibility to link a certain tool/equipment to a certain operator, similarly to what is done in a library when you want to borrow a book.
